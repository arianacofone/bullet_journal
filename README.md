# Bullet Journal

##Project MVP
To create a bullet journal application for the web. This method of productivity is currently only used in notebooks and I want to explore how to transition the particular bullet journal syntax onto the web.

##Technologies
HTML, CSS, JS, React, and Firebase.

##Next Steps
1) Create a rough draft of components based on initial visual design draft.
2) Create second draft of components and how they thread through one another based on design.
3) Create third component draft including functionality, and the threading through the app.
4) Create coding schedule based on framework.
5) Layout login page and user registration.

##Bonuses
1) Create a snooze page for bullet journal items to be called at a later date.
2) Hand draw components to fuel the organic design of app.
