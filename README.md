My life has in some way or another always centered around to-do lists. Yes, I am type A. Yes, I am organized. And yes, I'm one of those people who rewrites my to-do lists. Constantly. Usually I write them in notebooks, which are given to me by my lovely fianc√© who owns a note book company. No. Joke. It's the best.</br>

Now there's a trend in the notebook world called Bullet Journaling. Essentially, it's a specific note-taking syntax that designates tasks with a dot, events with a circle, and notes with a dash. Since most fans of this style only use paper journals as their canvas, I wanted to take a crack at transferring it to the web.</br>

Enjoy it on my <a href="http://arianadziedzic.com/bullet_journal/index.html" target="blank"> website</a>!

## Dipping Your Toe Into React
With CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Destroy) Apps making up so much of the landscape these days, React is a major win for developers when dealing with visually changing applications. During the wireframing of React apps the end goal is to create a domino effect so that when one change occurs in a particular aspect of the application, it'll trigger other components to change seamlessly.</br>

The example below is just a taste of what the syntax looks like, but to get a better explanation of what React does and how to jump in, check out <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html" target="blank"> React's Documentation</a>. Seriously, it's actually a nice read.

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';

const propTypes = {
  children: React.PropTypes.element.isRequired,
};

class Main extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div id="main-component">
        {this.props.children}
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default Main;

Main.propTypes = propTypes;

```
## A Tour of the end Results

Once logging into SYNC from the main page, the user's tasks, which have been saved in the Firebase database, are on the screen ready to go! To add an item, simply write in the input at the top and click whatever category it falls under (task, event, or note). From there, it's rendered on the bottom of the list.</br>

After your list is looking nice and productive, you have the options to mark it completed (check mark icon), delete it (x icon), or snooze it (clock icon). When completed the task turns green and when snoozed it turns grey, so you can forget about it forever. Just kidding! I wanted to make sure you were still paying attention. And that's that!</br>

## Future Components
Looking forward, there are two components I want to expand upon - the Snooze and Archive Components. Instead of the current version where the elements change colors on a click, I'd like users to be able to set a timer to snooze items and have done tasks automatically archived at the end of the day. Take a peak at the visual renderings below. </br>
